This mod is a restitched version of [mrsterner's fabric port](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-diesel-generators-fabric) of [george8188625's addon that adds Diesel Generators to the Create mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-diesel-generators). It is built on top of [Bugord's fork over on github](https://github.com/Bugord/Create-Diesel-Generators-Fabric-Refixed/tree/1.20.1).

**What's fixed:**

- most fluid issues, including pumpjacks pumping up oil at 1/81 of the intended rate
- oil canisters displaying 81 times their content when hovering over them in the inventory

**What's added:**

- using fuels like diesel to smelt items in the furnace
  - using fuels like diesel to fuel [Immersive Aircraft](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersive-aircraft) planes
  - using fuels like diesel in [Create: Steam 'n' Rails](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-steam-n-rails) fuel tanks to power trains

Known issues:

- the oil barrel is unfunctional
- the distillation tower's capacity is lower than it should be
- pumpjack cranks set to large will not visually connect to the pumpjack bearing

I'll fix as many as these as I can find time for, but I won't promise anything, as every gameplay-breaking issue is already fixed.
